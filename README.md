# tic-tac-toe

This is my first project. I wrote it on my own. It wasn't easy but finally it works correctly! 

This project gave me an extra expirience in javascript. I realized that writing code on my own is a totally different thing than writing with the course I used to. So at the begining it was a little bit challenging for me, but as you can see i did it ðŸ˜Ž 

Now the quick tutorial how to play:
(players who start the game are chosen randomly)
1. press the button called "start/restart"
2. enjoy the game ðŸ™‚
